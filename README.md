This is the repository of group 12 for the course of "02450 Introduction to Machine Learning" (DTU).\
This repository is a copy of [Aleksandar's repo](https://github.com/AleksandarLukic96/02450_Machine_Learning_and_Data_Mining), containing only the project material.

Group members:
- Andreis Marco: s243116
- Bellini Martina: 243118
- Lukic Aleksandar: 194066
Contribution to the members to both reports are clearly stated in the first page of the report themselves.

The project is divided in two parts:
- part 1 is focused on finding a dataset, highlighting the source and reason the dataset was created, visualizing the summary statistics of the attributes. Lastly also a description of how and which attributes lends themselves to classification and regression tasks. All materials in the project_1 directory.
- part 2 consists of performing both classification and regression. In particular focusing on the effect of regularization (weight decay for logistic regression, hidden_dim for ANN, number of clusters for knn) and the correct use of cross-validation. All materials in the project_2 directory.

The scripts are highly inspired from those present in the course Toolkit and have been adapted for our task. 

The only source of AI aids is ChatGPT, which was used only for identification of error while debugging the code and for making minor adjustment to plots (as to not get lost the matplotlib documentation).
